# RandBlock Rewrite

This is a compilation inspired by the vanilla Random Island datapack.  
The modpack will randomly refresh the vanilla and mod blocks every 3 minutes.  

The integrated package starts with the Ars Nouveau and provides an automated way to complete all quests.  
Also, throughout the quest line, the authors changed almost all of the recipe synthesis to fit the play flow.  

It's time to test your luck!  
Are you one of the rare players with great luck?
